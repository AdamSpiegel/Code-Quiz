# **JavaScript Code-Quiz**

## Project Description & Goals
   The goal of this project was to create and develop a functioning code quiz on Javascript.  The code quiz was to include a timer, multiple choice questions and a high score storage function as well.  The user was to be able to run through a series of questions, see their score, and then log their initials.  


## Action Items 

    1  Initially I developed my html, css and javascript files which had to be created and saved to develop the coding quiz upon.

    2  Next, my html code was developed to represent all components within my head, body, main and individual sections.  Of which, button classes, div ids and div classes were developed to function with javascript.

    3  Next, I began to develop my javascript which inlcuded all project variables intially.

    4  All quiz questions themselves were then developed and listed within the larger array, quizQuestions.

    5  An addEventlister was then created to develop functions for my timer and start quiz button.

    6  Console logs were created to track the funtionality of the timer and quiz questions being deployed.

    7  Next I created and developed the function runQuestions to deploy the questions to the user for answers.

    8 Finally, I utilized my css file to style the page accordingly so it was visually more appealing to the user.

    * Currently in Progress Due to Troubleshooting/Confusion - 
    *Items which I am currently having great difficulty with deploying and are still in development include:
      - progressing from question 1 onto the questions 2-5 appropriatley.
      - adding in radio buttons
      - generating the answers to display for the user
      - logging the users final score and initials
